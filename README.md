# cgsp
Coarse-grained spectral projection (CGSP): a deep learning-assisted approach to quantum unitary dynamics  
Arxiv page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09788

run 'python main.py' for CGSP of a 32-spin XXZ model.



Tips:
1. CGSP-adapted NAQS is defined in spectral_net.py
2. CGSP trainer is defined in cgsp.py
3. So far, model parameters and some hyperparameters are specified in main.py in a very sloppy way.
